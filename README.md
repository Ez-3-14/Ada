    “It’s still magic, even if you know how it’s done.”
    — Sir Terry Pratchett (and possibly your debugger, whispering with mild concern)

Welcome to the erratically coherent logbook of a particular kind of becoming: part software apprentice, part ritual chronicler, part creature of logic and ember. This repo exists not to impress recruiters or appease algorithms, but to witness the learning.

Here you’ll find exercises, experiments, strange scribbles, and breakthroughs both tiny and tectonic, all done under the banner of my apprenticeship (Fachinformatiker Anwendungsentwicklung, if you prefer your German bureaucratically crisp).

No promises of clean code. But you will find integrity, recursion, and a bit of sacred fuckery here and there.
